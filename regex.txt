REGEX:
\. -> Match any character
\d -> any digit
abc -> will match anything with abc in that order 
[abc] will only match a single a, b, or c letter and nothing else .
[^abc] will match any single character except for the letters a, b, or c.
a{3} will match the a character exactly three times.
One way to express such a pattern would be to use what is known as the Kleene Star and the Kleene Plus, which essentially represents either 0 or more or 1 or more of the character that it follow
 \? to match a plain question mark character in a string.
. In addition, a whitespace special character \s will match any of the specific whitespaces above and is extremely useful when dealing with raw input text.
One way to tighten our patterns is to define a pattern that describes both the start and the end of the line using the special ^ (hat) and $ (dollar sign) metacharacters.
